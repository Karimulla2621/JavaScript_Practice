Descriptions of Non-Implemented Functions:
Count Properties in an Object: You can count the number of properties in the person object by using Object.keys(person).length, which returns the number of keys in the object.

Convert Object to Array of Key-Value Pairs: You can convert the person object into an array of key-value pairs using Object.entries(person), which returns an array of the object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs.
